# Kainga



## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

Kainga is a way of setting up containerised Xserver and virtual network
computing (VNC) connections over a Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel. This allows
applications that require Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to run on a container
platform, in this case Docker, and be accessible over a VNC viewer through a SSH
tunnel.

This implementation uses Docker for the containerisation, this part is named
`matapihi`, the Te Reo Moari word for window, as it is the window into the
house, home or `~`.
